# Zomato-Restaurant-Recommendation-System
Leveraged AWS EC2 for cloud computing, Docker for containerization, and MongoDB as a NoSQL database to manage and analyze the extensive Zomato dataset related to Bengaluru restaurants. The project encompasses loading the data into MongoDB hosted on an EC2 instance, extracting and processing it within a Jupyter Notebook environment for in-depth analysis and recommendation system development.

The project workflow involves multiple stages from data loading, management, analysis, to the development of a recommendation system.​
1. AWS EC2 Setup:​
Amazon EC2 Instance: We set up an Amazon EC2 instance to host our application and services. This instance provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud.​

2. Docker Containerization:​
Docker Environment: Utilizing Docker, we containerize our application components, ensuring consistency and portability across different environments.​

3. MongoDB in Docker: We deploy a Docker container running MongoDB to store and manage our Zomato dataset. This NoSQL database offers flexibility and scalability for handling diverse restaurant information.​

4. Data Loading to MongoDB:​
The Zomato dataset is loaded into MongoDB hosted on the EC2 instance. This step involves data ingestion and organization within the NoSQL database.​

Conclusion:
The utilization of AWS EC2, Docker, and MongoDB provided a robust infrastructure for handling, processing, and extracting insights from the Zomato dataset. This project stands as a testament to the synergy of cloud computing, containerization, and NoSQL databases in empowering comprehensive data analysis and recommendation system development within the realm of Bengaluru's diverse restaurant landscape.​
